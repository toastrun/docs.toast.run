# Frequently Asked Questions

## Both Swow and Swoole enabled

```
Coroutine module is incompatible with some extensions that setup exit user opcode handler in Unknown on line 0
```

Swow and Swoole provides similar kind of facilities, so they are exclusive, please remove Swow or Swoole from your php.ini

## `Please re-run your program with "-e" option` when using SDB

```
> attach 3
Error: Please re-run your program with "-e" option in path/to/vendor/swow/swow/lib/swow-library/src/Debug/Debugger/Debugger.php:0
```

Append `-e` argument in php command line like: `php -e your_file.php`ã€‚
{: .waring }

When `-e` is enabled, PHP will call extension registered OPCode hanlder, this may harm performance in usual.

## "PHP Warning: PHP Startup: Swow pdo_pgsql hook not enabled" after Swow enabled

If you have Swow compiled with pgsql support, but no pgsql environment when starting:

- PDO extension is enabled: "pdo extension not enabled"
- No libpq found: "libpq.so/libpq.5.dylib/lipq.dll not found" "libpq is too old"

Then you will see this warning, and pdo_pgsql hook will not work.

If you need this support:

- Enable PHP [pdo extension](https://www.php.net/manual/en/pdo.setup.php)
- [Install libpq](https://www.postgresql.org/download/)

If you don't need this support, you can add an ini configuration:

```plain
swow.hook_pdo_pgsql = Off;
```
